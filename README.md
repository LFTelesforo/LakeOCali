# CLIKS Staycation and Condo Rentals

Welcome to the official website repository of **CLIKS Staycation and Condo Rentals** – your cozy home-away-from-home located near prime city destinations. This site showcases available units, a gallery of the spaces, and an easy contact form that connects directly to Messenger.

## 📌 Features

- Homepage with branding and service highlights  
- Unit listings with images and details  
- Gallery showcasing condo interiors and amenities  
- Contact page with a Messenger-integrated inquiry form  
- Mobile-responsive layout  
- Modern UI using Bootstrap and Materialize CSS

## 🚀 Deployment

This site is designed for static hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify). No backend or database is required. Messages are composed using a form and then passed to Facebook Messenger via clipboard + user redirection.

## 💡 How It Works

On the **Contact** page:
- Visitors fill out their name, email, and message.
- Upon clicking a button, the message is copied to their clipboard.
- SweetAlert notifies them, and a Messenger tab opens.
- They paste and send the message manually to either the page or the manager.
